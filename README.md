# solidity
Solidity is a programming language specifically designed for developing smart contracts on blockchain platforms, particularly Ethereum. Created to facilitate the implementation of self-enforcing code that runs in a decentralized environment, Solidity allows developers to create secure, immutable applications that can handle digital assets, execute transactions, and perform complex computations.

It supports features like inheritance, complex user-defined types, and libraries, which aid in building robust, modular smart contracts.
